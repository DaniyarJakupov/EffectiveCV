# EffectiveCV

Effective and elegant LaTeX template for your CV/resume.

This template is heavily inspired by [Modern CV](https://launchpad.net/moderncv) and [Awesome CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV). Both projects are very great but seems not maintained anymore. The output is very similar, but intended to be more formal and effective. The template is simple and easily customizable.
