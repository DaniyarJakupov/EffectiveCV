# EffectiveCV

Effective and elegant LaTeX template for your CV/resume. It is intended to be simple, effective and easily customizable.

This template is heavily inspired by [Modern CV](https://launchpad.net/moderncv) and [Awesome CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV). Both projects are very great but seems not maintained anymore.
